# react-iso

A basic template for a server rendered first react app with Express/Jade as base layout.

Inspired by https://github.com/pbeshai/react-express-example and https://github.com/mhart/react-server-example.

Compiled jsx and react dependencies are common to both client and server using grunt-react and browserify.

Install with `npm install`  
Run with `grunt && npm start`
